<h1>Development Plan</h1>

<pre>

1) Relational Schema
Songs(id → title, artist, album, release_year, genre, popularity)
Artists(name→ vibe)
Types(name→ intensity, timbre, pitch, rhythm) *subject to change based on Spotify info
Genres(name→ vibe)
Activities(name→ vibe, location)

CreatedBy(song_id, artist_name) 
Have(song_id, type_name)
InformedBy(playlist_link, ac_name)
VibeWith(ac_name, genre_name)
BelongTo(song_id, genre_name)
ContributeTo(artist_name, genre_name)

2, 3) Tech Stack and Data Sources
The data source we will be using to populate our databases is the Spotify Web API. Our stack will consist of Python, either Django or Flask, and mySQL
We will use the Spotify Web API to selectively populate our application with data. Activities and Types relations will be defined by us and potentially populated with web scraping

4) Division of Labor 
Sean: Will be responsible for working with the integration of mySQL and python through python (flask) + (HTML/CSS)
Sebastian: Will work with the Front end flask/django/mySql/python and interfacing Python with the backend
German: Will be responsible for populating the database and database features
Josh: Will be responsible for populating the database and database features
Together: Formulating the playlist generation equations (requires the entire group to agree on the equation) i.e. hoe exactly our application will assess input and compute a result
