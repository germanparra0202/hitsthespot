<h3>"Hits the Spot" Spotify Playlist Generator</h3>
<ol> 
	
	<li><strong>Description: </strong> Spotify Playlist Generator Engine that runs on various input forms such as a desired moods, intended occasions, sample songs, etc. to create a curated playlist.</li>

	<li><strong>Usefulness: </strong>Not everyone is blessed with impeccable music taste.  For multiple reasons, be they time, ability, niche, people can't always make their own playlists, but there will always be a need for a great playlist to supply the atmosphere for any occasion. "Hits the spot" allows for even the most uninformed playlist desirer to concoct a great playlist.  Similar smaller project ideas exist, however they are rather limited in the number of parameters they can recieve, and are largely dependent on the user's existing listneing habits.  Our application, aside from using the spotify API, will utilize web scraping of different online contexts to categorize songs more profoundly and be able to generate playlists from a wider set of parameters.</li>

	<li><strong>Realness: </strong>The majority of our data will come from the spotify api and will consist mostly of song metatata such as artists, views, genres, etc, but a significant portion of our data will also come from web scraping that will gather where songs have been found and attributed to</li>

	<li><strong>Functionality: </strong></li>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Basic Functions: </strong></li>
	
		<ul>


			<li><strong>Insert: </strong> Upon a new release, for example, our app regularly will fetch from the spotify API and categorize it based on its metadata to later be searched/queried</li>

			<li><strong>Update: </strong>Not regularly used as songs are not changed post release, but should a song need to be removed (for example taken off platform), a song can be updated and/or removed</li>

			<li><strong>Delete: </strong>Same as above</li> 

				<li><strong>Search: </strong>Majority of the function of the database: given various query parameters, our application will return a list of songs with the most similitude in order to fit the desired vibe/requirement/function</li> 

		</ul>

			
		<li><strong>Advanced Functions: </strong> </li>

		<ul>

			
			<li><strong>Song Fit: </strong> Given an existing playlist that a user enters, our database technology will determine how similar a song is to the remainder of the playlist and whether it is a good fit</li>
			<li><strong>Playlist Manicurer: </strong> Given an existing playlist, our app will determine which playlist songs are the most dissimilar/similar to each other and give suggestions for which songs to drop in order preserve the "vibe" of the playlist</li>
			

		</ul>


	</ul>

	<p>For our purposes, activities vibe with one genre, a playlist is informed by one activity and vice versa, songs can only belong to one genre (primary), and everything else is many to many (until further notice). </p>
